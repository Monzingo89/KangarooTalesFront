      Roadmap
    </Typography>
    <Typography paragraph>
      <ul>
        <li>‚è≥ Limited Edition Alpha (In Progress): Feature parity with the current MTG CB. This is being moved one piece at a time.</li>
        <li>
          Limited Edition Beta (March): As many of the new MTG CB features that can be squeezed in here (Tokens, Custom Collection Goals,
          and Foreign Cards).
        </li>
        <li>Unlimited Edition (June): Full release of the new MTG CB.</li>
        <li>
          Combo Winter (New): I need to invest some time in upgrading the libraries used by the new MTG CB. I'll do this after the main
          release.
        </li>
        <li>Revised Edition (TBD): The v1.1 update adding a single new requested feature.</li>
        <li>
          Future Updates (TBD): Future updates will follow the same pattern of v1.2, v1.3, and so on, each adding a single new feature in
          focused iterations.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </Typography>
    This page will eventually be a snazzy homepage, but for now, you can use it to see what's new in the latest build and what's coming up
    next. Feel free to send me any feedback via Discord or Patreon! <em>There will be bugs. üêõ</em>
